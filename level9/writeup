instead of gdb we can use ltrace to find the address
of where the program `memcpy`s to
since the program tries to execute a method from a vtable,
and that a vtable is an array of pointer to functions, it
dereferences it twice (to execute the first element of the vtable)
so we need to overwrite EIP with an address that points to
an address to our shellcode.

PS: don't try to find argv's address!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
