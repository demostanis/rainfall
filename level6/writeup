we need to overwrite f->fp with &n, which `cat`s the flag.
unlike with the stack, addresses of memory allocated on the heap
always need to be a multiple of 8. so either we guess the right padding
between the two addresses, or we can use a pattern with e.g. metasploit:

  ./pattern_create -l 100
  <use this as input in gdb>
  ./pattern -q <address>

metasploit tells us the program segfaults trying to execute what's in
the pattern at index 72, so we pad our exploit with 72 'A's
