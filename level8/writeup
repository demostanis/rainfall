if you open the program in ghidra, you'll find out
it's pretty unreadable. that's becasue several calls to strcmp()
are inlined.
the programs reads the standard input for commands:
 auth, reset, service and login

the reset command always free(auth)s, even if auth has
already been freed. this causes a double-free vulnerability:
when a pointer is freed, its pointer is added to a list
of free pointers. since it can be called twice, we can
have the pointer appended twice. when malloc gets called,
the previous auth's pointer will be returned. if we call
malloc again, however, the same pointer will be returned!

we use the service command to manipulate the auth structure,
which we fill with 33 'a's (to fill name, and to make
auth->auth true)
