"Code such as printf(foo); often indicates a bug, since foo may contain a
% character.  If foo comes from untrusted user input, it may contain %n,
causing  the  printf()  call  to write to memory and creating a security
hole."

the program spawns /bin/sh if m (a global variable) is equal to 64.
we write &m in the buffer, along with some random formats for %n
to write in the correct address (we need to skip 3 bytes in the stack).
we also pad some %c with %nc for the total length (before %n) to be 64.
