gets() reads a line from stdin into the buffer [...].
**No check for buffer overrun is performed**

the program gets() in a 76 bytes buffer (as can be seen
in ghidra, by checking ./source, or by using metasploit
pattern tools).
we can fill this buffer with anything, followed by eip's value
(next instruction's address, which we point to the run() function,
which spawns /bin/sh)

since our pipe closes when the file is done reading, /bin/sh's
stdin is closed, so we can't type any command. thus we also read
-, to keep stdin open
